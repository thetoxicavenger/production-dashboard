# Production Dashboard

## Objective

This project demonstrates my ability to create and manage user sessions using ExpressJS and MongoDB.

## Usage

Allows users to view all my projects currently hosted on DigitalOcean - this is accomplished through Node.JS server-side calls to the DigitalOcean API, which are then injected into a front-end Jade template.

## Application

This application is currently live at http://104.236.130.96.
